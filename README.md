# odin-recipes 
This is my first project with TOP. 
I will be creating a little web page for recipes.
I am going to be demonstrating the skills I have learned so far such as:
learning the use of git and github, creation of directories and files, modification of those directories/files, use of boilerplate HTML and adding content (i.e. titles, headings, paragraphs, links, images, and lists)
