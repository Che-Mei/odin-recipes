    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Salmon filets</li>
        <li>One large lemon</li>
        <li>6-10 Brussel Sprouts (the amount depends on size of the sprouts - the larger they are, the less needed)</li>
        <li>Magic Salmon seasoning</li>
        <li>Olive oil for drizzling</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Cooking oil spray for the pan</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400F. Grab a sheet pan and spray with cooking oil. If you are going to make rice, now is the time to get that started if using a rice cooker.</li>
        <li>Wash, dry, and cut brussel sprouts in half. Place them on the pan flat side down.</li>
        <li>Cut the lemon in half. On one half, cut two thin slices (or one slice for each filet) and set them off to the side for now.</li>
        <li>Place your salmon filet(s) on the pan. With the lemon half that had the slices cut off it,
            squeeze the juice on the filet(s) to taste. (We squeeze the living daylights out of it)</li>
        <li>Next, coat the top of the salmon with Magic Salmon seasoning. And now we can place our lemon
            slices on each filet.</li>
        <li>Returning to our brussel sprouts, lightly drizzle olive oil over the sprouts. Then season to taste 
            with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Once the oven is preheated, our pan is now ready to go in! Set a timer for 20 minutes. If making rice in a rice cooker, this should be finished around the same time as the oven.</li>
        <li>Let cool a couple minutes and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
